Project Overview :

We  conducted a comprehensive analysis of loan data, examining various KPIs such as year-wise loan amounts, revolving balances, and state-wise loan status. By scrutinizing these metrics, we've uncovered trends and correlations that can drive better lending practices and financial planning. Our findings provide insightful observations and actionable recommendations for stakeholders in the financial industry

KPI's

A] Year Wise Loan Amount Status.

B] Grade And Sub Grade wise Revolving balence.

C] Total_Payment For Verified And Not Verified status .

D] State and Month wise Loan status .

E] Home_Ownership vs Last payment Date_status.

Steps Followed

1] Data Cleaning : Bank analytics Dataset Has 2 large CSV Files (Finance_1 and Finance_2) with 39475 rows with Null and blank cells. We cleaned the datasets by removing the null values, blank celss and some unwanted columns which are not needed.

2] Merging Dataset: After cleaning the datasets by using the power query in powerbi and excel both the data sets were merged using the common column.

3] Data Visualizations: Building Dynamic Dashboards using the above KPIS build different visualization charts like Barchart,Column chart,pie chart,Ribbon chart,Matrix,slicers.

Key Insights

A] The Total Loan amounts have steadily increased year after year, with 2011 marking the highest amount and 2007 the lowest.

B] Our Grade B Revol Balances are favorable compared to other grades, but we must take action regarding Grade G.

C] California state boasts the top fully paid loan status with 154 cases, but we need to address the charged off items.

D] We provide four distinct categories of home ownership. Up until 2011, the 'Rentâ€™ Have held the highest loan amount among them, but 'Mortgage' has consistently maintained the highest loan amount since then

E] We need take an action on not verified accounts. Because these account going forward will create loss.

F] These increasing loan amounts reflect a growing credit demand and borrowers' willingness to seek financing for various needs.
